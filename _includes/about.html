H2020 Programme 688135. STARS4ALL aims at creating conscience in the public about the
negative effects of artificial light in human beings, biodiversity, stars visibility, security, and
energy wastage. Following this aim, Octal is born with the objective of developing citizen data
science experiences in which people from around the world could participate in workshops to

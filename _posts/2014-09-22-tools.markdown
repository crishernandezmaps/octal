Octal develops night sky observation experiences by using an open source spectrometer. This
device takes qualitative and quantitative measures of light pollution in situ. Originally created by
Public Lab, this spectrometer was modified to measure light pollution using a mobile phone in
two ways; counting starts, and measuring the light spectrum. The data collected through the
device is then analysed in the Octal workshops to determine and compare levels of light
pollution in different urban areas.
